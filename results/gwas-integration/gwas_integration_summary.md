# AMD GWAS Integration Summary

Overlap between IAMDGC loci and PRG4 rescue: 6 genes.

### PRG4-Rescued GWAS Genes
These genes are linked to AMD risk and are upregulated by PRG4 treatment in H2O2-stressed RPE.

### GWAS Genes as Virtual Screen Hits (Mimetics)
Knockdown of these genes mimics the PRG4 rescue signature. High correlation means knockdown ~ PRG4.

### GWAS Genes as Virtual Screen Hits (Antagonists)
Knockdown of these genes opposes the PRG4 rescue signature.

No GWAS genes found as antagonists above threshold.
