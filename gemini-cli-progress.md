# Project Progress Log

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **START HERE:** New agents should read these files in order to understand project context and standards:
> 1. `project_overview.md` (Biological context)
> 2. `results/Tannin_AMD_Analysis_Report.md` (Summary of scientific findings)
> 3. `planning-mds/coding_preferences.md` (Visualization & Coding standards)
> 4. `planning-mds/GPU_ENVIRONMENT.md` (Hardware/Venv environment)
> 5. `planning-mds/future-ideas.md` (Roadmap)
>
> **NOTE:** Do not include signatures like "Generated by Gemini CLI" or "Organized by Gemini CLI Agent" in any created files.

## 2. Dataset Mapping & Findings

- **GSE135092 (537 Human Samples)**: Detailed PCA shows strong tissue-specific effects (Macula vs Periphery). Confirmed that PRG4-restored genes (*CFH*, *RPE65*) are those most depleted in human disease.
- **GSE29801 (293 Human Samples)**: Independent validation using Microarray. Confirmed global downregulation of risk pathways in AMD.
- **GSE129964 (Serum Starvation Timecourse)**: Demonstrated longitudinal decline of RPE markers, confirming the "atrophic" signature PRG4 opposes.
- **K562 GWPS (Genome-Wide)**: Identified **KEAP1** and **DICER1** as primary therapeutic mimetics.

## 3. Tool & Script Inventory (Newly Created)

- `code/external-validation/fetch_external_data.py`: Multi-dataset GEO downloader and processor.
- `code/external-validation/process_gse135092_raw.py`: Advanced viz (PCA/Tissue-stratified plots) for RNA-seq cohort.
- `code/external-validation/visualize_gse29801.py`: Probe-to-gene mapping and validation for microarray cohort.
- `code/external-validation/visualize_gse129964.py`: Timecourse plotting for atrophy model.

## 4. Next Steps: Clinical Translation

1.  **Drug Repurposing**: Query CLUE.io with the PRG4 UP/DOWN gene lists.
2.  **GWAS Integration**: Overlap Virtual Screen hits with AMD risk loci.
